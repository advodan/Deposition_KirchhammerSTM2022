Comparison of the two CODEX runs by Nicole for the Ad-IL12 story. The idea is to see if IL12 has different effects in the two tumor models. Ideally, it has much more effects
in the EMT6 model, where the effect on tumor growth and survival are much bigger than in B16. The basis of this analysis is the glm negative binomial model run in separate R files
here I just load these results and perform some plots
