This is the analysis of the EMT6-HER2 Codex Multiplex Imaging Interaction Counts. Counts of interactions for different clusters are the initial data.
These interaction counts are compared statistically and plotted. This analysis is the first part of the analysis for Figure 1F together with the B16_Codex_InteractionAnalysis and the final B16vsEMT6_CODEX_interactions folders.
